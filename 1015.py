# Hint
# Given a positive integer k, you need to find the length of the smallest positive integer n such that n is divisible by k, and n only contains the digit 1.

# Return the length of n. If there is no such n, return -1.

# Note: n may not fit in a 64-bit signed integer.

 

# Example 1:

# Input: k = 1
# Output: 1
# Explanation: The smallest answer is n = 1, which has length 1.
# Example 2:

# Input: k = 2
# Output: -1
# Explanation: There is no such positive integer n divisible by 2.
# Example 3:

# Input: k = 3
# Output: 3
# Explanation: The smallest answer is n = 111, which has length 3.
 

# Constraints:

# 1 <= k <= 105


k = 1
# k = 2
# k = 3

def xyz(k):
    if k % 2 == 0 or k % 5 == 0:
        return -1
    
    rem = 0
    for length in range(1, k + 1):
        rem = (rem * 10 + 1) % k
        if rem == 0:
            return length
    
    return -1
