# Given the root of a binary tree, the depth of each node is the shortest distance to the root.

# Return the smallest subtree such that it contains all the deepest nodes in the original tree.

# A node is called the deepest if it has the largest depth possible among any node in the entire tree.

# The subtree of a node is a tree consisting of that node, plus the set of all descendants of that node.

 

# Example 1:


# Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4]
# Output: [2,7,4]
# Explanation: We return the node with value 2, colored in yellow in the diagram.
# The nodes coloured in blue are the deepest nodes of the tree.
# Notice that nodes 5, 3 and 2 contain the deepest nodes in the tree but node 2 is the smallest subtree among them, so we return it.
# Example 2:

# Input: root = [1]
# Output: [1]
# Explanation: The root is the deepest node in the tree.
# Example 3:

# Input: root = [0,1,3,null,2]
# Output: [2]
# Explanation: The deepest node in the tree is 2, the valid subtrees are the subtrees of nodes 2, 1 and 0 but the subtree of node 2 is the smallest.
 

# Constraints:

# The number of nodes in the tree will be in the range [1, 500].
# 0 <= Node.val <= 500
# The values of the nodes in the tree are unique.

# Definition for a binary tree node.
