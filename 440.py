# Given two integers n and k, return the kth lexicographically smallest integer in the range [1, n].

 

# Example 1:

# Input: n = 13, k = 2
# Output: 10
# Explanation: The lexicographical order is [1, 10, 11, 12, 13, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], so the second smallest number is 10.
# Example 2:

# Input: n = 1, k = 1
# Output: 1
 

# Constraints:

# 1 <= k <= n <= 109

n = 13
k = 2

# n = 1
# k = 1

def xyz(n,k):
    current_prefix = 1
    k -= 1
        
    while k > 0:
        count = countNumbersWithPrefix(current_prefix, n)
        if k >= count:
            current_prefix += 1
            k -= count
        else:
            current_prefix *= 10
            k -= 1
        
    return current_prefix

def countNumbersWithPrefix(prefix, n):
        first_number = prefix
        next_number = prefix + 1
        total_count = 0

        while first_number <= n:
            total_count += min(n + 1, next_number) - first_number
            first_number *= 10
            next_number *= 10

        return total_count
